# Images-gallery
Images gallery with html css jquery

A raw and ugly gallery <br>
Feature:
- Fixed navigation bar and sticky on scroll (only the background changed so far).
- Navigation bar with dropdown item.
- Dropdown list single and multiple level.
- All image are clickable and redirect to the corresponding wiki page.

Skill used:
- Html
- Css
- Jquery

A lot of things is still broken, maybe I should learn to use some framework and comeback later.
